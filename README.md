# Library_Entry_System
The MITCORER Library Visitor Management System is a smart, barcode-based application developed to track and manage student and faculty visits to the college library. It automates the entry and exit process by scanning barcodes, logging each visit in real-time, and displaying visitor details instantly.

The system supports automatic detection of a visitor's department, year, and designation based on their barcode, and even shows their profile photo retrieved from the database. A real-time dashboard displays live statistics such as total visitors for the day, current occupancy, and most visited departments.

With built-in auto-exit functionality, the software ensures all active visits are closed at a specified time (e.g., 9 PM), even if the user forgets to scan out. It also includes a detailed analysis module where past logs can be filtered by department, designation, and date.

Designed specifically for MIT College of Railway Engineering & Research (MITCORER), this system makes library management accurate, efficient, and fully digital.
